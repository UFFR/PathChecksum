# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Versions before v2 are considered obsolete and won't be patched, please update to the latest v2 release.

It is highly doubtful that either major version should have any vulnerabilities, but you can never be too safe.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 2.0.0   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 2.0.0 | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

You can report a security vulnerability like any other problem by opening an issue with the `vulnerability` label.

Please do not email me your problems, I don't check it often and don't want it spammed anyway.

## Submitting Pull Requests

All pull requests should be signed with a valid GPG or SSH key, not just security ones.
